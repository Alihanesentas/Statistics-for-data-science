. It provides efficient and trusted methods to estimate and draw inferences, plus estimate characteristics of the whole population along with testing hypotheses
2
. Sampling theory is fundamental in various fields, including market research, political polling, quality control in manufacturing, and scientific research. Moreover, it aids surveys, observational studies, and experiments. Researchers use it for data collection of animals, plants, and other organismsâ€™ populations. It finds usage in testing and inspecting processes and products

Sampling theory is essential for efficient data collection, cost-effectiveness, informed decision-making, population representation, practicality in complex situations, and statistical analysis support
2
. In statistics, sampling theory refers to the practice of choosing a subset entity or individual out of a larger population to make inferences about the population based on the sample
2
. Researchers employ a random or systematic sampling method to ensure unbiased pictures. They then analyze these samples and draw appropriate conclusions concerning the larger financial landscape
