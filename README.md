#  SAMPLÄ°NG
*In statistics, sampling refers to the process of selecting a subset of individuals or items from a larger population with the aim of making inferences or conclusions about the entire population. The subset chosen is known as the sample, while the entire group being studied is referred to as the population.*

*Sampling is a crucial aspect of statistical analysis because it allows researchers to gather data efficiently and make generalizations about a population without having to study every individual within that population. However, for the inferences drawn from a sample to be valid, it's essential that the sample is representative of the population it is drawn from.*

# CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 
*A confidence interval is the mean of your estimate plus and minus the variation in that estimate. This is the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your test, within a certain level of confidence. Confidence, in statistics, is another way to describe probability.*
